There are 3 main functions:

1. Create a graph
2. Get the possible moves of a position
3. Get the shortest path based on the graph (Using BFS or Dijkstra)


The graph is created by adding all the possible moves with edges to the previous move.
All moves have a cost of 1, so the path with lowest costs is the path with least moves.

Currently it creates for every position 8 points in the graph untill it did this for 
all positions on the field. Causing it to be terribly slow for fields bigger than 12.

The first time I made it terribly inefficient to create the graph second time
I used a more straight forward approach by creating it based on the field so 
no need for recursion.

The stupid inefficient version is found in Horse.create_stupid_graph and Horse.shortest_path_stupid
the better effeicient version is found in Horse.create_smarter_graph and Horse.shortest_path_bfs.

It's better to use BFS as all edges are the same weight: 1, so no need for Dijkstra.

The smarter graph function loops through every position and then loops through the possible
moves and adds them to the graph. This way it only takes n*n * possible moves.
